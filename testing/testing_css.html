              <h5 style="color:#7CFDF4";> Why are Strawberries yummy? </h5>
              <p> The balance of sweetness and acidity is very important to the taste of a strawberry. As strawberries ripen, their sugar content rises from about 5% in unripe green fruit to 6â€“9% on ripening. At the same time, the acidity decreases, meaning ripe strawberries taste much sweeter.</p>
